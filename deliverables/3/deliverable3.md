# IS2545 - Software Quality Assurance
Fall Semester 2016

DUE 20 OCT 2016

## Deliverable 3

For this assignment, you will write systems-level, automated black-box tests for a e-commerce website using the BDD model discussed in class.  That is, you will write user stories (features) and scenarios, and then use JUnit and Selenium tests.

Tests and code should be on GitHub by the end of class on the due date.

There are NO partners for this deliverable.  Everybody is responsible for working on their own assignment.

The e-commerce website is located here: http://store.demoqa.com/

Your GitHub repository should contain a README.md file. It should contain the following information.

For the summary, add a description of issues you faced when writing these tests and problems you would expect going forward based on your experiences.  If any tests you wrote fail, they should be included here.  Also note if there are any special steps to get the tests running.

There shall be 3 (three) user stories - no more, no less.  Each user story should have multiple (at least two) scenarios.  There shall be a total of at least 9 scenarios.  One way to do this would be three scenarios per user story, but you may find that it makes more sense to have, say, five scenarios for one story, and two scenarios each for the other story.

User stories should all follow the Connextra (as a/i would like to/so that) template.  Scenarios should all follow the Given/When/Then template.

You may use Cucumber or JUnit to drive your tests. If you use JUnit, tests shall have the scenario that they are testing written in the comments above the particular test.  All tests shall correspond to a scenario and vice-versa. There should be one test class per user story.

Remember that scenarios are USER-level tests; they should discuss things in a way that an intelligent user of the software would understand.  Remember the differences between scenario tests and unit tests!

## Grading
* Summary and Testing concerns - 10% 
* User Stories and Scenarios, written in the proper format - 35%
* JUnit Tests - 55%

Reminder that all code (project under test AND test code) should be available to me.

Please feel free to email me or come to office hours to discuss any problems you have.
